## Classification

  compliance navigation for an already-incorporated operator
- Social impact: [:ukrainian-sme-market-access :public-spend-transparency :cross-border-friction-reduction]

## Customer

- an already-incorporated `cloud-itonami-cofog-{code}` /
  `cloud-itonami-isco-{code}` / `cloud-itonami-unspsc-{segment}` /
  `cloud-itonami-{ISIC}` operator wanting to bid on a Ukrainian
  public contract
- a foreign SME or civic-tech vendor entering the public sector in
  Ukraine for the first time
- a `cloud-itonami-M6910` client that has just completed incorporation and
  now needs public-sector market access

## Offer

- registration walkthrough for Prozorro, Ukraine's open-data public
  e-procurement system through which all state, municipal and
  state-owned-enterprise tenders flow, launched in 2014 as a joint
  civil-society/business/Ministry of Economic Development effort and an
  internationally recognized open-source procurement platform
- business/tax registration checklist: an EDR (Unified State Register of
  Legal Entities, Individual Entrepreneurs and Public Associations) entry
  administered by the Ministry of Justice, with the resulting EDRPOU code
  serving as the primary identifier across tax, customs and court
  systems; a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) for bid submission
- local-content / preferential-procurement navigation: Prozorro's
  transparency and open-data disclosure requirements and any applicable
  domestic-preference provisions on qualifying tenders
- ongoing regulatory-change monitoring subscription
- compliance-audit export package for the client's own records

## Revenue

- per-engagement market-entry fee (one-time registration + checklist
  completion)
- recurring regulatory-change monitoring subscription
- compliance-audit export package

## Trust Controls

- any actual portal registration or filing submission requires
  Market-Entry Compliance Governor clearance and always escalates to
  human sign-off (`:filing/submit` is never automated at any phase)
- a false or fabricated regulatory-requirement claim is a HARD hold that
  cannot be overridden by human approval alone — it must be corrected
  against a cited official source first
- this service does **not** provide legal or tax advice; characterization
  and filing on the client's behalf beyond checklist/draft assistance
  routes to Ukrainian-licensed counsel or a registered agent
- every requirement cites the official portal or regulation, never
  invented

## Boundary with adjacent actors (read before forking)

- **`com-etzhayyim-ooyake`** (etzhayyim/root): read-only civic-wayfinding
  mirror of government structure, non-commercial, barred from acting as
  or for the government (G3 impersonation ban). This blueprint is
  commercial and never claims to be an official channel.
- **`matsurigoto`** (etzhayyim/root): sovereign e-government statecraft —
  literally the government, for etzhayyim's own covenant or an adopting
  nation-state. This blueprint is an independent operator the government
  contracts with or that bids into its procurement — never the
  government.
- **`com-etzhayyim-toritsugi`** (etzhayyim/root): guides a consenting
  INDIVIDUAL citizen through their OWN procedure, non-profit,
  donation-only. This blueprint's client is a business operator, not an
  individual citizen, and it is commercial.
- **`legal-entity.etzhayyim.com`**: read-only aggregated company-registry
  data, no execution. This blueprint executes (gated) registrations.
- **`cloud-itonami-M6910`**: helps a client BECOME a legal entity
  (incorporation, ISIC 6910) — a prior, different regulatory phase
  (company law). This blueprint assumes incorporation is already done and
  handles public-procurement market entry (a different regulatory domain).
- **`cloud-itonami-cofog-{code}`**: a jurisdiction-agnostic operator
  template for ONE public function. This blueprint is the orthogonal
  jurisdiction-specific axis — the two compose (fork a COFOG-function
  blueprint AND this one to operate in Ukraine).
